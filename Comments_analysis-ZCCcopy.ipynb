    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advisory K\n",
    "**Advisory K** is a wholly owned Zimbabwean firm, and the first and only official partner in Zimbabwe of [Mercer Global](www.mercer.com) – the largest and leading HR Consulting firm in the world. Through our enriched experience, and our access to global best practice and solutions in Strategy, Organisation and People solutions, we are the preeminent firm in the country delivering cohesive strategy and organisational services focused on the public and parastatal sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We help our cients know more and do more\n",
    "Through our five practice areas we help our clients **Know More (Research & Analytics)** so that they can **Do More (Strategy, Organisation and People)**. We have a strong belief in the value of data and in data-driven decision making in an organisation. Our suite of services is designed to ensure that reliable data drives each part of any organisation as we take it from Knowing to Doing.  \n",
    "![image.png](PIcture1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research and Analytics\n",
    "The **Research and Analytics** Practice Areas provides our clients with data driven strategic insights. Our data driven approach ensures **subjectivism is kept to a minimum** and **FACTS** are a major component of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the **Research and Analytics** arm of **Advisory K**, one of the several products we offer is **Survey Research** specialising in:\n",
    "1. Survey Design and Deployment\n",
    "2. Survey Administering\n",
    "3. Survey Analysis and Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Survey Analysis\n",
    "Making sense of responses. Tie-up all different responses to come up with an objective actionable insight of what the respondents perceive as a group. For all questions in a survey where responses are measured by a numerical scale this is easy as an index for the perception can be calculated, for instance a Customer Satisfcation Index (CSI).\n",
    "However, for free comments, it is difficult to make sense of a large amount of various responses addressing various concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Case \n",
    "How do we efficiently identify the concerns and suggestions that customers raise in the free comment section of the survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "Create a model for Text analysis of Customer Satisfaction Survey free comments and suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project approach\n",
    "1.\tResearch on text analysis and the various algorithms used. \n",
    "2.\tEvaluate the different algorithms and choose one that best addresses the need taking into consideration:\n",
    "    * quantity of data\n",
    "    * scalability\n",
    "    * continuity\n",
    "3.\tImplement chosen algorithm from custom template\n",
    "4.\tCreate an executable script that is easy to use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "## Set up... \n",

    "* program code \n",
    "* program code output \n",
    "* visualisations\n",
    "* narrative text \n",
    "* mathematical equations\n",
    "* and media eg pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to do the project in Python since it is the programming language of choice in Data science. The language also has an extensive range of ready to use libraries and modules that greatly shorten time to program and allow you to get results faster.\n",

    "2. Secondly we break up the filtered texts into individual words. This is called [Tokenization](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13698/tokenization).\n",

    "At this point, we observe that **LSI** provides topic models with a coherent semantic reference. In this instance it is the best model to use compared to another model known as **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** because **LSI** is less sensitive to the amount of data than **LDA**, given we are working with just over 3000 comments to conduct our analysis. However, with more comments (apprximately 10000 comments) **LDA** tends to provide more better results than **LSI** \n",
