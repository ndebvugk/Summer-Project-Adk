There is overload of patients on the machines and over time this might affect the functioning of the machines as they are always running

The patient was denied access to talk to the optician after they prescribed spectacles she cannot afford. She wanted to have her prescription altered.

i had to wait for 40min for the confirmation from cimas as to whether they go ahead and give me medication or not. i think there should be a protocol that enables a one click method and facilitate access into the databases.
unsatisfied because was going for dressing for a wound daily but would spend a lot of hours waiting unattended and this was displeasing since the patient is 60 and diabetic which forced him to discontinue the service and seek help from private pharmacies

building is delapidating
There is need for more doctors.
no water in taps for washing hands and tissues
presenting identification each time you visit the centre  is not necessary and crutches are too expensive
no drinking water
sessions per year are too few
the lady who sits by the door who handles accounts is not helpful and polite
add more sessions per year
"the service is slow , and sometimes they do not consider the elderly"
The members of staff's uniforms should be improved  . They need new uniforms
"laboratory results took forever, they mentioned of a defect with the machine after they had taken samples. i think there is need to improve on that and the technician did not apologies regardless i had my child for almost 4hrs and she was becoming agitated."

"MY husband has been going for rehab for the past couple months and his company used to pay the bills but he has been sacked off so they have stopped paying and we cant afford the bills, is there a means that he can continue receiving treatment since he has been a client for a while. "
machines need upgrading
facility should be disability friendly
the inner rooms are too close to each other. there should be a way to separate the rooms so that they become entirely separate from the next. when patients are passing to another room they can interfere with the other other patient's attention.
The rehabilitation staff were discussing about not getting paid among themselves and this was disturbing to the patients 
The reception staff is not polite in they were not helpful. They do not notify us about changes well.

"THERE IS NEED FOR TOILET SIGNS , I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO USE THE BATHROOM, AND I COULDNT FIND THE TOILETS. AND THEY ARE FAR FROM THE WAITING AREA AS WELL AS THE RADIOLOGY ROOM "
5they should add more equipment for exercises
The food at the Hillside Hospital is served cold and will not be covered.
THE SERVICE WAS POOR. I WAITED FOR OVER 6 HRS TO BE SERVED. 
The staff at the reception were attending to their own private business instead of serving the patients and this was displeasing
the machines were breaking down
So far so good.
service is too slow at the reception we take too long to get served. there are long queues
scanning machine is too  small the radiologist was making assumptions on the sex of the baby because screen was too small and hazy.drinking glasses are not often washed in time for clients to use
"The reception staff were aloof, and not very efficient"
the first refused me service because I had no hard cash. I had Ecocash in my wallet but they asked for had cash. I had to move around town in agony to find cash yet I was in pain. I was served late afternoon yet I had came early morning because of cash constraints.
blood clotted and pipes bursted
number of scans should not be limited.scans should clearly also show the patient what the radiologist would be describing
there is an improvement. appointments are now organised and they now ask what type of food you want to eat.
The members of staff were busy chatting while patients were waiting
"THERE WAS NO DETAILED REPORTOF THE SCANS AND XRAYS, AND I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. I AM STILL CONSIDERING GOING BACK . "

They need to avail drugs soon after the visit from the clinic

too many shortfalls."
Some of the doctors sometimes seem to be in a rush even when there aren't many patients waiting service and simply question the patients without examining them
"they did not cal me after my glasses were ready, i had to go find out for myself."
The b.p and temperature check queues are too long and patients spend too much time awaiting service
we need senior doctors who knows what they are doing 
The waiting area space and chairs are not enough to accommodate patients during busy periods. The gents' toilet had no door
"front office has no order.

The guard directing patients could be more friendly and not use a military approach. Queues to the reception and to the doctors' should be separated to avoid confusion. The waiting area should be more spacious

Spectacles should be processed also in kwekwe because sometimes it takes too long to come back
"Patient was unable to pay for his spectacles because the machine at the unit was not accepting Swipe, he is not sure if this is always the case or it was just a problem on the particular day"

they are not polite."
frames need to be readily available
shortfalls are too much 
services take too long.
The reception staff should acknowledge customers' presence. Sometimes the guard is actually the one aiding customers. Equal service should be provided at all centres. One shouldn't have to be referred to other centres for items such as frames

Appointment times should be observed and a cleaning cloth for the spectacles is needed
spectacles did not come in time. 
Frames should always be readily available so that patients don't wait for them for many months
The waiting area should have refreshments for patients
The waiting period between trying to make an appointment and actually being asked to come is too long considering one will be without spectacles. Two toilets instead of one are needed
Notifications when spectacles are ready should be sent to customers
i could not get the help that i wanted because they said they only assist people after 3 years 
Should communicate with customers about changes in some conditions of spectacle replacement. Patient travelled from afar only to be told spectacles are now changed after every 3 yyears instead of 2
"Excellent services, they should keep up with the good services, westgate branch is the best but they need to work on time of delivery of spectacles."
Customer has spent one and half months waiting for her spectacles to be ready. At one point she was told they were ready only to be told they were missing. After following up she was asked to get a new frame which requires a large shortfall. Major inconvenience for customer

The spectacles do not come with a cleaning cloth
"the waiting time for the spectacles was too long, they need to find a way to shorten the waiting time period."
Doctors seem overwhelmed with the numbers and can't give patients enough one on one time. The unit needs to issue spectacles quickly and efficiently. Patients are experiencing problems paying shortfalls for spectacles
"we should get feedback after launching complaints, spectacles expire after 3 years but they say we are getting those which expire after 2 years."
3 years is a long period to wait until my next appointment with the optician

"shortfalls are not clarified, there are no toilets and the doctor cannot speak Shona"
"When patient went to collect her spectacles, they were missing even though their receipt had been recorded. Patient returned home and the staff promised to contact her once the spectacles were found however there was no feedback from the unit and patient had to follow up at the unit herself. She suspects foul play may be involved and that the staff is changing customer's frames"

staffed. The frames on offer are too limiting"
"waiting time is too long.
"
they need to provide with cleaning cloths for our glasses.
there are no toilets
communication with the doctor is difficult since he is not shona
machinery must be improved 
The foreign doctor at the facility needs an interpretor to best help patients who are not fluent in English. The patient would like to be given more information on the material frames are made of so as to make the right choice. Separate toilets for men and women are needed
Availability of opticians all the time
not satisfied with shortfalls
